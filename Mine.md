## This is Minesweeper but in First person and 3D

I recreated the game of MineSweeper but put a twist on it and created the gameboard as a walkable platform that the player can traverse across with a first person character and uncover the tiles on the ground one by one to solve the puzzle of minesweeper and beat the game from an alternative perspective compared to the original 2D grid that the original game operates in.

This is done by first assigning each block with a bomb or a number based on a predetermined chance (20% chance) which is how the gameboard is populated with bombs. Once the board has been populated I use a script that detects how many bombs are around it to then assign said square a number corresponding to the amount of bombs sorounding the specific tile.

The player navigates across the board with the First Person Character uncovering tile after tile slowly solving the puzzle.
