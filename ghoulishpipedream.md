## This is Ghoulish Pipedream

[Ghoulish Pipedream Itch](https://kimpeters.itch.io/ghoulish-pipedream)

Ghoulish Pipedream is a split-screen 2 player game in which 2 players must work together, one playing the role of Larry who is a paranormal investigator eeking to prove the existence of ghosts while being assisted with this objective by the other player who plays the role of the nameless ghost who is bound to earth by his innability to remember the reason of his death.

I created a script that would allow the person that is playing as Larry to be able to pick up and carry both small objects and big objects such as keys, crowbars and boxes to move them from one place to another to solve puzles layed out throuh the house.

The ghost is able to free-fly through walls and pick up small objects from place the player cannot reach such as a high shelf to drop them down thus working together to get through the puzzles in the haunted house.

The gohst has the ability to turn on lights when near them so that the human player can navigate through the level without having to be in the dark.
