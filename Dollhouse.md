## This is Dollhouse

The Dollhouse is a game that I am currently working on with my Development team at University. Dollhouse is s horror game based in a dollhouse in which the player hyas the role of a cute toy creature running away from a big scary Action Figure that is an AI run enemy that hunts the player nonstop as long as they are within eyesight of the action figure.

I have mainly worked on the stun mechanics and brakable objects within the game which consist of the player being able to pick up objects and or friends and throw them at the enemy chasing the player through the house to stun them for a short time to give the player a chance to get away and escape.

The Destructible objects that I am working to create now is done through the chaos engine in Unreal which I am working to make objects only destructible under certain conditions.
